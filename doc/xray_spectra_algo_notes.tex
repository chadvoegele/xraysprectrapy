\section{Radial Density Function}
\subsection{Calculation of Distances with Periodicity}
Suppose a large chemical structure has uncountably many atoms but they follow a
periodic pattern of $n$ atoms every $p$ Angstroms. The atom locations within a
period are given by $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ where $a_i \in \mathbb{R}^3$. The
radial density function is the distribution of pairwise distances between these
atoms.

The distances $d$ between atoms $a_i$ and $a_j$ where $i \neq j$, atom $a_i$
has been displaced by $x$, and atom $a_j$ has been displaced by $y$ per the
periodicity is 
\begin{align*}
  d^2 &= \langle a_i + x - (a_j + y), a_i + x - (a_j + y) \rangle \\
      &= \langle a_i-a_j, a_i-a_j \rangle  + \langle x-y, x-y \rangle  
      + 2 \langle a_i-a_j,x-y \rangle 
\end{align*}
where $x =(k_1 p, k_2 p, k_3 p)$ for $k_i \in \mathbb{Z}$ 
and $y = (l_1 p, l_2 p, l_3 p)$ for $l_i \in \mathbb{Z}$.
Here $\langle x,y \rangle $ denotes the inner product between $x$ and $y$. 

Suppose $D$ is a random variable that samples at random the distances, $d$, in
the chemical structure. The radial density function is the probability density
function of this random variable. This function can be estimated empirically via
a histogram.

The histogram is then normalized by the volume a spherical shell.
\begin{align*}
  \frac{4}{3} &\pi (r + \Delta r)^3 - \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3\\
     &=\frac{4}{3} (3 r^2 \Delta r + 3 r (\Delta r)^2 + (\Delta r)^3) \\
              &\approx 4 \pi r^2 \Delta r
\end{align*}
where $\Delta r$ tends to zero.

For a histogram with frequency, $f$, for bin $[d_i, d_{i+1}]$, we replace $f$
with $f / d_i^2$. And then normalize the histogram so that the sum over all bins
is one.

\subsection{Adding Noise For Atom Vibration}
Due to the vibrations of the molecules, the radial density function will not be
just the equilibrium positions. We can approximate this fluctuation in distances
via a Gaussian filter or Weierstrass transform.

\begin{align*}
F(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{4\pi t}} 
  \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(y) e^{-\frac{(x-y)^2}{4t}} dy
\end{align*}

Given that the density function is only defined for a finite number of
distances, we use a discrete version of the transform making sure to keep the
sum of the weights equal to one.

\begin{align*}
  F(d_k) = \frac{\sum_{d_i = d_0}^{d_n} f(d_i) \exp\left(-\frac{(d_k -
                  d_i)^2}{4t}\right)}
            {\sum_{d_i = d_0}^{d_n} \exp\left(-\frac{(d_k - d_i)^2}{4t}\right)}
\end{align*}
where $d_0$ is the minimum distance and $d_n$ is the maximum distance.

\subsection{Experimental and Theoretical RDFs for Known Structures}
For some structures, we are able to theoretically calculate the RDF from atom
locations and also have the experimental RDF from Xray scattering. These known
matches provide some insight into understanding how the experiments and theory
align. The RDF comparison are shown below.

Outside of these structures, there are not many other known matches. There are a
few reasons for this. First, if a structures is already known at the atomic
level then there is no need to run an xray diffraction experiment. Second, if a
structure is periodic as in a lattice, the atomic structure can be determined by
xray diffraction which is easier and cheaper than xray scattering.

\section{Smoothing Analysis}
Consider a function, $SmoothAndNormalize(i, t)$, that smoothes the image, $i$,
with a smoothing coefficient of $t$ and then normalizes the smoothed image so
that the weights sum to one. To calibrate the smoothing coefficient, we focus on
the SiLi calculated and experimental matches, SiLiCalc10001 and SiLiExpt1. We
want to find the smoothing coefficient, $t$, that after smoothing and
normalization the calculated image is the closest match to the experimental
image.
\begin{align*}
  \hat{t} = \underset{t}{\arg\min} \| X -
    SmoothAndNormalize(C, t) \|_2
\end{align*}

where $\|\cdot\|_2$ is the $L^2$ norm, $X$ is the experimental image, and $C$ is
the calculated image.

We found that $\hat{t} = 0.0092$.

\section{Matching Algorithm Evaluation \label{s:algo_eval}}

The goal of this project is to invent an algorithm that will find the best
matching calculated image for a given experimental image. A more audacious goal
is to find an algorithm that can decompose experimental image into a linear
combination of a few calculated images.

Before running an experiment, it is possible to theoretically predict the
feasible structures that could occur during the experiment. Given this matching
algorithm, during the experiment, we could match the experimental results back
to the theoretically predicted structures. This would give an 'x-ray vision' into
the structures, being able to see that atom locations as the experiment
progresses.

One way to evaluate the performance of a proposed matching algorithm is to use
the set of known experimental and calculated matches. Taking the set of
calculated images as a whole, the algorithm should be able to recover the
calculated match given the experimental image. 

The problem with this evaluation metric is that there are only three known
calculated/experimental matches. This is not a large enough number of samples
for good statistics. The reason there are not too many matching pairs is because
the known structures at this time are periodic and can be observed
experimentally through cheaper x-ray diffraction experiments. Non-periodic
structures which are the focus of this project are studied precisely because
their exact structures are not known.

An alternative approach to using the calculated and experimental matching pairs
directly is to simulate experimental images by adding random noise to a
calculated image. The goal then becomes to recover the original calculated image
given the simulated experimental image.

\begin{figure}[ht]

\subsection{Noise Analysis}
The experimental images present three different varieties of noise compared to
the calculated images.

\begin{itemize}
  \item{Tilt: Consider the baseline of the image to be the piecewise line
      connecting the valleys of the image. The experimental images seem to have a
      non-zero and slanted baseline compared to the calculated images which 
      have a baseline at zero.} 
  \item{Noise: Between the major peaks of the experimental images, there are
      also several minor peaks. These minor peaks are not found in the calculated
      images.}
  \item{Peak Heights Difference: The heights of the major peaks vary between the
      calculated and experimental images.}
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{figs/inas_valleys.eps}
    \caption{In As}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

To simulate these features, we first estimated the distributions of the number of
peaks, peak locations, and the noise peak heights. 

\subsubsection{Peak Counts}
To estimate the distribution of number of peaks per image, we took all of the
experimental images and estimated the number of peaks. Then we visually inspected
the histogram to estimate the distribution.

From the histogram, we concluded that the number of peaks is uniformly
distributed between 7 and 15.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{figs/peak_counts_hist.eps}
    \caption{Peak Count Distribution}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

Note that the estimation is strongly dependent on the maximum length of the
image. The raw InAs spectrum goes out to 10 angstroms and has much more than 15
peaks.

    \caption{InAs Expt, Max 10 Angstroms}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}
\clearpage

\subsubsection{Peak Locations}
To estimate the distribution of the location of the peaks, we first took all of
the experimental images and calculated the distances of all of the peaks. Then
we charted this as a histogram to visually inspect the distribution.

From the histogram, we concluded that the locations are uniformly distributed
between 1.96 and 7.
\begin{figure}[ht]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{figs/peak_counts_hist.eps}
    \caption{Peak Location Histogram}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}
\clearpage

\subsubsection{Noise Peak Heights}
To add noise to the image, we add random noise directly to the original
frequencies.  That is, $N = I + R$, where $N$ is a vector of frequencies for the
noisified image, $I$ is for the original image, and $R$ is for the random noise.

In light of this, to estimate how much noise to add, we first calculated $E = X -
C$, where $E$ is the error or noise to be added, $X$ is the experimental image,
and $C$ is the calculated image. We considered the errors at different distances
to be independent and thus considered all of the errors to be for any distance.
Taking all of the errors together, we estimate the error distribution. From the
histogram and cumulative distribution function, we concluded that the error
distribution is most similar to a normal distribution. The estimate for the mean
is 0.004 and standard deviation is 0.004.

\clearpage

\subsubsection{Sample Noisy Image}
To generate the simulated experimental images, we first sample the number of
peaks, the peak locations, and the peak heights from their respective
distributions. Then this noise is added to the original image and the resulting
image is re-normalized.

\section{Recognition Using Eigenfaces}
In this section, we apply the approach outlined in Turk and Pentland's
"Eigenfaces for Recognition".

Let $C = [c_1 \ldots c_n]^T$ be the calculated images and $\Psi$ be the
column-wise means of the $C$.

First compute the principal components of $C$ by singular value decomposition.
\begin{align*}
  \mbox{Cov}(C) \sim (C - \Psi)^T (C - \Psi) = W \Sigma^2 W^T
\end{align*}

Here $W$ are matrices that contain the loadings of C. Each column has different
principal components and the rows span the dimensions of the images.

The first $L$ loadings, $T_L$, are computed with the first $L$ principal
components. Let $W_L$ be a matrix with the first $L$ columns of $W$. Then 
$T_L = (C - \Psi) W_L$.

Suppose $X$ is the target image that we are trying to find a best match for.
First compute the loadings, $S_L$, for $X$ as $S_L = (X - \Psi) W_L$. Then use
the $L^p$ norm to find the closest image in PCA space.
\begin{align*}
  \hat{i} = \arg \min_i \| T_L(i,:) - S_L \|_p
\end{align*}

\subsection{Mean Image}
Below shows the mean image, $\Psi$, over all of the calculated images.
\begin{figure}[ht]
  \begin{center}

\end{figure}
\clearpage

\subsection{Variance Explained by Principal Components}
Principal component analysis projects the data onto an orthogonal space. Thus in
PCA space, we can consider the variance contributed by each of the principal
components separately and can identify those principal components that
contribute most to the variance of the data set. To identify how many principal
components are needed to explain the majority of the variation in the data set,
we can look at the cumulative variance.

\begin{align*}
  C_k = \sum_{i=1}^{k} \sigma_i^2 / \sum_{i=1}^n \sigma_i^2
\end{align*}

where $C_k$ is the variance explained by $k$ principal components and
$\sigma_i^2$ is the variance of principal component $i$.

From the graph, we notice that around 15 principal components explain about 95\%
of the data.

revealed. Not much of anything is noteworthy.

\subsection{Data in Eigenspace}
Below shows the data in principal component space for the most significant
principal components.

One feature we observe is that the first principal component separates the
experimental data very well and in fact appropriately sorts the silicon lithium
structures by that amount of lithium. Higher principal components are not as
useful for distinguishing the experimental images.

\subsubsection{Eigenspace Outliers}
Given that the higher order principal components did not separate the
experimental images, we looked at the images with high loading values. 

From the plots below, we notice that the higher order principal components
capture the very high peaks in images. Indeed for some images that have very few
peaks, after normalization those peaks will become much higher than those images
that have many peaks.

\subsection{Synthetic Experimental Image Recognition}
Here we run the alternative analysis approach outlined in section
\ref{s:algo_eval}. The exact method is described below.

\begin{verbatim}
For i = 1 to nSamples
  calculatedImage = randomlySelectFrom(calculatedImages)
  experimentalImage = addNoise(calculatedImage)
  bestMatchImage = findBestMatch(experimentalImage)

  If bestMatchImage == calculatedImage Then
    increment successCounter

Accuracy = successCounter / nSamples
\end{verbatim}

Below we consider findBestMatch functions that find the minimum L1 and L2 norm
in PCA space for all principal components.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{figs/PCAAccuracyVsLpNorms.eps}
    \caption{Synthetic Experimental Images Accuracy}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

Here we check how the accuracy varies as we increase the number of principal
components. We see that the accuracy does not change much after 15
principal components. This aligns with our conclusion from the cumulative
variance chart that 15 principal components are sufficient to describe much of
the variance in the data set.

The different lines in Figure \ref{f:accByPC} refer to different trials of the
synthetic experimental image analysis.

\section{Recognition Using Sparse Representations}
Following the lead of Wright, et al. in "Robust Face Recognition via Sparse
Representation", we apply the method of recognition via sparse representation
to the xray images. The idea is that we try to express the experimental image as
a sparse linear combination of calculated images. If the solution is
sufficiently sparse, then the sparse solution can be found by minimizing the
$L_1$ norm of the coefficients.  The best match is then are the images that have
non-zero coefficients. One application of this that is outlined in Wright et
al's paper is to choose the best match as the image that produces the lowest
error after being multiplied by its coefficient.

\begin{align*}
\left(\begin{array}{ccccc}
c_{11} & c_{12} & c_{13} & \ldots & c_{1n} \\
\ldots & \ldots & \ldots & \ldots & \ldots \\
c_{m1} & c_{m2} & c_{m3} & \ldots & c_{mn} \\
\end{array}\right)

\begin{align*}
c_i&: i^{th} \mbox{ Calculated Image} \\
C &= [c_1 c_2 \cdots c_n] \\
x&: \mbox{Target Image}\\

We wish to find the solution that is sparsest with bounded error. This can be
found via a second order cone programming problem.

\begin{align*}
\hat{y} = \underset{y}{\arg\min} \| y \|_1 \hspace{1em}|\hspace{1em} \|Cy - x\|_2 \leq \epsilon
\end{align*}

\subsection{Experimental Image Recognition}
Here we show the best matches for the experimental images using the sparse
representation method. This method is able to recover the correct matches for
the known experimental and calculated pairs. The matches for most of the
experimental images seem reasonable as well. For SiLi experiments 6 through 8
though, the matches are quite bad.

All results following were run with an error bound of 0.000001.

\subsection{Synthetic Experimental Image Recognition}
Running the synthetic experimental image recognition analysis with the sparse
representation approach yields surprisingly bad results. Below the results are
plotted with different error bounds.

\subsection{Composite Image}
The sparse representation method by definition solves for the sparsest linear
combination of images that best match the input image. In the context of xray
spectra, it is possible that the experimental image is a linear combination of
images from multiple structures. This is due to the time averaging as the
structure changes and also locality in the structure. Here we plot the linear
combinations to see how they compare to the experimental image.
